## Abstract
This article is a critique to the following paper: The association between early career informal mentorship in academic collaborations and junior author performance, by AlShebli, Makovi, and Rahwan. I started by questioning the assumption and data source of the paper, which is essential for any statistic paper. Then analyze the most important issue: what drives the association that relates to female performance different than male in the mentor-portege setting. The result is yet to be shown as this is only a outline.


## Introduction
The aforementioned paper studied 3 million mentor-portege pairs and conducted analysis on the impact of the mentor-protege relationship to the protege and mentor. The result shows that female mentors has a significantly less gain in the relationship than male mentors, and has a worse outcome towards female proteges in staying in academia and provides them with better career outcomes. This article is intended to do a indepth examination of the creation process of such result, and provide readers with my conclusion on this matter.
